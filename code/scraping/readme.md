##Scraping Yelp

This tutorial covers scraping reviews and other more detailed information
of businesses on Yelp. This is built upon the existing work of 
[kgodey](https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-api/tree/master/v2/python) to make 
API calls in order to get meta-data of businesses. If just having the 
meta-data is not enough for you, i.e. you want all the reviews of the 
particular business, you have come to the right place.
